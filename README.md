# justlink.co - A smarter URL shortener

Justlink.co redirects you to the most relevant website, given a short description.

For example, `justlink.co/facebook-privacy` redirects to Facebook's privacy policy.

Built with Python and Django, and works by scraping the search engine [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com/) for the top link for the user's description.
